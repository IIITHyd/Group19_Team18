In a rare stroke of irony the latest LIBOR rate just tweeted by the BBA. It's 0.90. Don't worry I rang #Barclays traders to get it earlier!
Just a little thought. Where does Barclays' abuse leave the efficient market hypothesis  http://ht.ly/bRlZx 
Lawyers using words like   limitless   to me to describe potential legal liability Barclays and other banks face from LIBOR fraud suits.
For those of you asking, money FSA gets from Barclays' fine will be used to cut the fees banks have to pay to FSA
Firms complaining over interest rate swaps say cases might be helped by Barclays judgement...interesting with FSA set to rule on Friday
I have just reported Barclays PLC to the Tower Hamlets Division of the Metropolitan Police http://wp.me/p2wHxu l2 
Whatever the chat #newsnight this Barclays Libor thing includes the possible next boss of the Bank of England! Somebody should go to prison.
#barclays #newsnight. I call for a public enquiry   a Levenson   into fraud, manipulation   wrongdoing of British bankers   role of BBA. .
BREAKING. The former Barclays boss John Varley when criminality took place is in line to become Bank of England boss.

Shouldn t Bob Diamond be giving back his bonuses from the years when Barclays manipulated the market, not this year @bbcr4today  
#Barclays  290 million total fine is 10 days' profit based on first quarter results.
And yes, it's only 60 million of the Barclays' fine being paid here to FSA   rest goes to the US authorities
I may be a simple country parson, who deals in widow s mites rather than billions: but why hasn t Barclays management and Board resigned 
Ed Mili ratchets up pressure by calling for criminal prosecutions in Barclays interest rate fixing scandal. Quite right to do so
Why are Barclays not being prosecuted under Section 4, Fraud Act 2006  http://bit.ly/OBqqVT 
#Barclays lies went on from 2005 to 2009. Four execs give up 2012 bonuses. What about bonuses paid 2005 2009 on cheated trading results 
Thousands of people are in jail as a result of debt but lying #Barclays scammers walk free. Bob Diamond you are scum
