Battery lost charge today on the #BMW   nothing obvious   even lost the time :) a few hours on charge and we should be back running...
The BMW broke down in the middle of the interstate. I am causing a huge traffic jam. Sorry!
I swear bmw stays with electrical problems smh
Finally! BMW back on the road! Then the hood flew up and broke, shattered my windscreen. Steered to the side and had a good laugh.
Started the bmw up, running like shit. The stress my poor m52b28 must go through. Not starting again until I replace the head gaskey
Fourteen hours away from home and the BMW breaks down. #epicfail
