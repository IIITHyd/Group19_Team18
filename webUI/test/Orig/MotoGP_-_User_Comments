@MotoGPJules was last weekend a 1 off for rossi      Thats the question....i see him back at yamaha and lorenzo to honda  
I favorited a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/5EqQG978dRw a  Catalunya   Yamaha Preview
Yamaha boss Lin Jarvis 2 MCN on Lorenzo's future.  I d have liked to have signed him just before Le Mans.  
Jorge Lorenzo @lorenzo99 has been the first Yamaha rider across the line in each of the first four races of 2012.
WINNER the YAMAHA VICTORY RACING !!!!!!! 99
@DazHindle I know it was my dream since about 11! But the worst move ever! But he'll never go back to yamaha if they don't kiss and make up!
@Romanee B Yeah it is! If he wins the championship on Yamaha, I think he will stay :) x
@munkster109   WOW! Lorenzo confirmed at Yamaha MotoGP for 2013   2014.   ( @TobyMoody)
Expect many zero's on JL's contract... Honda offer would have been alot to beat. Best move for him, he and the Yamaha are great combination
Lorenzo re signs for Yamaha, 2 year contract. Didn't expect that to happen so quickly, if at all! Over to you Mr Rossi...
Waw, how bout ben spies    @AziFarni: Jorge Lorenzo has signed with Yamaha for 2013 and 2014  
Big piece of 2013 puzzle solved then with Jorge Lorenzo signing a new 2 year deal with Yamaha
@motomatters I'd like to see Nick on a Yamaha.
Backstage with team lorenzo Yamaha at silverstone http://lockerz.com/s/217604464 
Just saw Valentino Rossi going into Yamaha's hospitality!! Don't get too excited though, he just attending Agostini's 70th birthday do
Congratulations for Jorge Lorenzo from Yamaha Factory Racing Team
@swiss r1 get cal that the other yamaha!!!
@Albinowes @valeyellow46 MM will ride the Repsol and Honda can only have 4 prototype bikes. Yamaha have a good line up. Tough to call. Vale 
@inthegravel you have to factor in how much Yamaha could potentially offer him compared to Honda, no main sponsor for Yamaha for 2 years now
@calcrutchlow. Best of luck for the race Cal, ride that Yamaha like you stole it!
Right spies,dovi,cal help yamaha and Lorenzo kill theses Hondas!
Nooooooo @lorenzo99 @MotoGP Pedrosa takes the lead in front of Stoner and Spies,the only Yamaha Factory Racing running after Lorenzo's crash
So all riders chose the harder front slick for the race, Dani   Casey on soft rear slicks, Yamaha's and Ducati's on hard rear slicks #MotoGP
@R1Racing71 @PaddockChatter Sealed  Not totally, but Yamaha certainly have to be seriously thinking about it now.
@wanderers1960 10 metres on a yamaha or honda. Over a lap that's a long way. So on each corner to make that up is what they will aim for.
@JakeNewstead is racing at Oulton Park #BSB this weekend. Will you be coming  #yamaha
@sharemotodotcom cals stats looks like the back end of a yamaha 
@46Mell Let's hope it goes better I don't think he'll stay at duke but far to many bridges burnt at Honda and yamaha so where to next
Champagne in Yamaha :) pic.twitter.com/JUJgL8mq
@calcrutchlow You should be able to defeat all the Yamaha factory riders..
@M Turco If Yamaha intend to announce signings in Indy that means they will renew with Ben. no 
@lorenzo99 any worries that the   new   version of the hrc honda will be fast/better bike than the yamaha
