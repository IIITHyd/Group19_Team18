@bantamskatee @MattySzaf98 I said I think they MIGHT be the first act on at the new arena next year. I'd prefer Springsteen or U2 though :o)
Damn, Chi Rithy's comeback was sick, but Mago's U2 read to take the match was God like. #CEO2012
@JackMurphy95 Not a chance pal, their no #U2 but theyve some serious tunes, their live show is really good aswell
  Alyssa likes U2.     who is this  I don't even know this song.     oh, maybe it was Phil Collins.   #ShitMicheleSays @lyssuhh 18
