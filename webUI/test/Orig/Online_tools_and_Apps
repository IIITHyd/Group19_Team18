@laurakalbag Yeah i use it with Barclays for my Ltd business etc
@RealToughCookie it's ridiculous. I am constantly moaning to barclays. Even more frustrating when you build systems yourself as we do
RT @dgwbirch: #da12ecom Barclays chaps says 900k Pingit downloads to date,  1.5m per week in p2p transfers
Barclays advertising their new app for fast cash transfers called 'Pingit' ... NatWest introducing theirs called 'Slingit' 
  Stuart Crawford ( @StewTitty) has sent you  11 'Naked Cuddle Payment'. The funds will be paid into your Barclays PingIt account.  
Just experimented with @Barclays #PingIt! Impressed to find a slick usable app, instant cash transfers to/from a colleague, and easy setup.
