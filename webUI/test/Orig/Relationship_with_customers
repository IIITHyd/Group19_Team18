Just told @Sirius rep for the 7th time not interested in service. Wish @subaru usa wouldn't have given them my info. #blockingtheircall
Bout to buy the @subaru usa BRZ if they can't fix my swapped RS but the parts guy is a straight up jerk
Went to look at a new Subaru BRZ today, dealer told me if I ordered one today, I would get it it in July, 2013. What ! ! !
Sure did! :D We hope you have an awesome summer, Joelle! | RT @j stilly: RT @SubaruOfNewEng favorited: It's gonna be a Subaru summer
