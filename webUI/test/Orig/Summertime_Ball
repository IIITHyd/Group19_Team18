JEALOUS the wanted are on stage right now and I'm not at the summertime ball :(
I want The Wanted not Cheryl Cole, asdikjhgfasusdfghjki!!!!!! Capital needs to sort its self out.
I want to see them again. Make them come back. Capital put the wanted back on stage.
i love how one direction havent played at ONE summertime ball, yet the wanted have played at THREE, oh yeah.
