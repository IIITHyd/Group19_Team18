blown out beyond recognition...yet eerily evocative: RT @keithfwhitman:  No Quarter  by Led Zeppelin is my new jam.   http://t.thisismyjam.com/keithfwhitman/ 200ufjm  
 100 RT @Anjar Dmc Nah! RT @ishomnia: Led Zeppelin   Stairway to Heaven
  All of My Love   was the closest Led Zeppelin ever came to turning into Firefall.
Led Zeppelin's Stairway to Heaven is so perplexing of a song to me. How the hell does it say what it says, backwards  #SoCreepy
It just hit me that Led Zeppelin's song   Whole Lotta Love   is just Robert Plant using a euphemism to sing about his penis
Fuck! That Gotye song IS everywhere. It's even track 2 on Led Zeppelin IV
I be tearin UP my air guitar when I hear Whole Lotta Love by Led Zeppelin. #JudgeMe
