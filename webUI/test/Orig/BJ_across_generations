But how awesome is Bon Jovi seriously. ROCK NEVER DEATH.
@TaiTheWanted1D Aww Id buy it for you! haha, my mum understands cause she was like this when she was young.. but with Bon Jovi not 1D lmao.
Hard to believe that the horrors of two World Wars   Bon Jovi took place in the same century.
Getting back at mum with   I bet you did the same for Bon Jovi  
#InMiddleSchool I was a huge Bon Jovi fan
1983, #thisdayinmusic A New Jersey based quintet calling themselves Bon Jovi signed to Phonogram's Mercury records
#ToMyFutureKids I'm going to introduce you to AC/DC, Aerosmith, Bon Jovi, Matchbox Twenty, Stereophonics etc when you can talk.
The only rock songs I like is the old rock songs from our parents time. The classics. Like Queens, Bon Jovi, Styx, Heart, etc.
