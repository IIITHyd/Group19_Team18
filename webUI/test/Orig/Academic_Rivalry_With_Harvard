Yale University: Harvard is always giving Yale noogies and telling it to stop hitting itself in the face.
For the 1st time in more than 3 centuries, Harvard   Yale will concurrently offer the same course: http://j.mp/r4ved3
@WatchWTF Utweet uhhhh, harvard  I said my ABC's backwards, my ass is going to YALE!
@jimcramer Good one, Jim. The Hill is run by elitists (Harvard vs. Yale). One year the Crimson wins, next Blue. They have sucked us 4 yrs
Solid difference between great traditions   great rivalries. Harvard Yale is great tradition, America at large could care less of   rivalry  
I'm sure Harvard and Yale beef like this too
