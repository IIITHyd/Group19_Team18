Big news! SharpDevelop vNext will be MIT X11 licensed. We will be able to share more code between MonoDevelop and SharpDevelop again!
This week I want to buy a Mac, then I write MIT code. There must be some truth in 2012 being the end of the world.
@appstudi sorry guys, but I don't have time to do it now, license is BSD, MIT or Apache on your choice
