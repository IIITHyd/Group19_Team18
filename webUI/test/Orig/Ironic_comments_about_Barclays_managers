Barclays manager has raised a complaint against himself! Picked the wrong guy to mess with, Ive cut my teeth argueing with Npower and BG!
Love that the top guys at Barclays have been created by the Beano, Bob Diamond and Rich Ricci. Can't wait for Monty Moneybags to take over
Wait, Barclays  seriously  has a chief executive named 'Ricci, Rich'  http://group.barclays.com/about barclays/about us/rich ricci
