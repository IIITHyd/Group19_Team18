Debating whether or not to wear my Led Zeppelin shirt in school because fuck the system
also tempted to wear my cousin's torn led zeppelin shirt just for shock value.
@AlexBarajas94 i know man i kid :) opinions shall be opinions! I like your led zeppelin shirt tho
@GinaValerio @ironmaiden Yeah, the day my son walked in with a Led Zeppelin t shirt on, I almost cried.
Original Led Zeppelin 1975 US Tour tee. Birthday gift in advance. Gotta love the bassist!
