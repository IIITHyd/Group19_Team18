Got passed by the Nissan Deltawing. Very cool to see out on circuit. Did have flash of Delboy as it turned in to first chicane though!

@LeMansLive @Nissan OnTrack @highcroftracing Why is the Deltawing in the pits for so long 
Check this show! http://www.ustream.tv/channel/6913352  Nissan Delta Wing pit box. #LM24
Race has restarted. And the lead #Toyota has just bumped into the #DeltaWing, knocking the #Nissan off the track and damaging itself badly.
So the Nissan DeltaWing was a nice idea but has failed fairly early on really... :( #LM24 #LeMans #LeMans24hr #24HoursOfLeMans
I sure hope the #nissan #deltawing will be back at next year's #lemans #24hours
@NissanMotorCo Thanx for DM! I feel sorry crush of DELTA WING. But it is one consolation Mr.Motoyama didn't had a bad injury. GO NISSAN GO!
