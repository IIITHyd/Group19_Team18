#TextsThatGetNoReply one of Adele's friends   Hey, gym in half an hour   
New River Monsters on tonight!! Adele and Khloe Kardashian will be swimming in the Mississippi.
Apparently Adele is suing the makers of the hunger games for stealing the tittle of her autobiography #Norrised
I can't tell if Adele is more focused on her voice or dicing up that air cheese plate with her knife fingers when she performs.
