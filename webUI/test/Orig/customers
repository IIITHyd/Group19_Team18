@chrismarks83 no I bank with hsbc! All my bills come out this week as well so I'm probs at my limit! Food and drink on @NjtWales next week
@joes85 luckily I get paid into hsbc so should be ok on that front!
So glad I bank with HSBC. They are not perfect but they are good enough for me.
@NadimMuslim Sounds about right... My parents are with HSBC so I was with them anyway, but I got a free money box :D
