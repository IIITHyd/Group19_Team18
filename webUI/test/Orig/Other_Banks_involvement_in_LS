I bet RBS thought 'Thank f  k for that' when they saw the news about Barclays.
#RBS rumoured to be involved in LIBOR / #Barclays scandal. Wonder if they'll ever be a banking cock up which doesn't involve RBS
Somewhere in Edinburgh you can hear the RBS PR team:   phew   they seem to be saying #Barclays #libor #liebor
Chairman of RBS says of #Barclays bosses   If they knew what was going on they deserve all they are going to get   multi million   wages then.
