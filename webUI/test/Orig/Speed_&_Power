The week seems to go by at the speed of a snail. Unless it's the weekend. Then the snail rides a damn ferrari.
I was in my yellow car but my ferrari go faster
  Life is like a Ferrari, it goes too fast. But that's ok, because you can't afford it anyway.  
Did my hair for 19 hours. Walk at the street, a Ferrari past by, my hair goes back to Afro.
Left lamborghini, right ferrari.. My neighbours are showing off their rides! Hiyaaa.. The sound of it scares my kittens.
