I love those political bumper stickers all over your subaru outback. they really make me wanna date you.
@TanMcG I love Vermont. I'd move there in a heartbeat but I don't have enough political bumper stickers on my Subaru. Or a Subaru.
If you have a Coexist bumper sticker and a Subaru, you should pay double the fine when you roll through a stop sign. Then punched.
So, in light of that, to honor my passing, I'll be plastering all used subaru's in j town with said stickers. In remembrance of me. Beware.
