Sooo. 2 Chainz, Mac Miller, and Asher Roth remix to Justin Bieber song Boy Friend is so nice!
#nohomo but if I had the money, I'd go to the Justin Bieber concert. His music is good :)
I don't know why some people hate Justin Bieber, he's a good singer so why  
I've got loads of respect for Justin Bieber, but it's a shame I can't say the same for his music.
ive heard justin bieber is going to do a dubstep album ...... RIP dubstep
