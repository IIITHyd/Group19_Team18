  @thewriteformula: When you think of how good Alonso has been in a crappy car, imagine if Ferrari finally crack it. Wow.  this is what i say
@Crucial Xtreme Jason,Alonso is fastest in sector one so Ferrari should be very good in next races that are not speed and traction only 
@Shanemurphy1988 Ferrari has good long run pace   looks after tyres. Surprised they qualified so high. Back Alonso for championship now !
Alonzo fastest two sectors and looking to steal the lead. Go Ferrari! Go Alonzo! #F1
So sad to see Alonso and Ferrari struggling, couldn't happen to a better pairing #F1
