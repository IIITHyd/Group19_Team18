I   u SEAN   One And Only (by Adele). You are the one I'm waiting for in #indonesianidol 2012.
I have never heard rolling in the deep in my life and I'm gonna hear it cause fany sang it. adele, be proud
Upon second listen, I do like Fany's Rolling in the Deep a little more, but I still think she should have started with an easier Adele song.
Damn she sang Rolling In The Deep really well o o being an Adele song there's high standards involved, and I think she pulled it off nicely.
@thebrianapaige oh god no anything but Adele XD and her songs aren't that high pitched
Leanne reminds me so much of adele and Kelly Clarkson mashed in one..
RT   @ItsSahraa: I like leanne but we don't need a happy version of adele ok.   LOL omg. She's nothing like Adele. Completely different voices
leanne  really  she's not gonna get anywhere, she's just an unfunny Adele and the people love Adele #ukthevoice
Adele is currently on the phone to her hitman to have Leanne   taken care of  . #TheVoiceUK
So Leanne, or the new Adele as she'll now be known as, wins #TheVoiceUK
