@PeterBeinart didn't Obama close hundreds of dealerships laying off thousands of workers to make GM   Chrysler stronger  Same as Romney did.
@JDKoof USA losing 750,000 jobs per month when Obama took office. GM and Chrysler bankrupt, all major banks collapsing, 2 wars, not fact 
#BigGovernmentObama GM and Chrysler  submitted a plan to restructure  and  neither goes far enough  #tcot #rnc #truthteam #obama2012 #dnc
@MittRomney find the GM   Chrysler dealers closed by Obama. Have the owners   fired employees cry a river over Obama having them fired.
@TheDemocrats Chrysler's owned by Fiat, GM has laid off 000's, and the American taxpayer has a many billion   loss in GM. Great success, OB!
