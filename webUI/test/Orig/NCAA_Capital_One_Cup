Making progress RT @CharlieTerenzio . @USFAthletics is ranked No. 47 for men and No. 54 for women in this year's Capital One Cup Standings
In what's perceived to be a down year, UF now leads Men's Capital One Cup Standings, should win with decent showing @ CWS. UCLA only threat.
Be warned, that if Orlando and Orange County continues holding the renovations to the Citrus Bowl, we may even loose the Capital One Bowl!
South Carolina beats Arkansas in the #CWS, meaning UF will win the Capital One Cup on the men's side for second year in a row. #Gators
