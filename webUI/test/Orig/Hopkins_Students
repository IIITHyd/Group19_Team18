@MotherinMed I did this as MS3 from U MD rotating thru surgery at old VA w/ Hopkins MS4s   surgery residents/faculty  loved it #meded
Met interesting individuals   had great conversations on the plane with a medical student @ Johns Hopkins   a contemporary/mix media artist
Watching Hopkins 24/7. Pretty sure they just dropped a pair of lungs that they needed to transplant into a guy...oopsy whoopsy!
