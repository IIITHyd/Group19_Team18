What is wrong with Madonna, why does she have to make such a big deal over #BornThisWay. @ladygaga would never act like that.

Thank you Gaga is trending, reductive fans much  #Madonna fans thanked her yesterday already
idk it's not right to compare Madonna   Gaga...Madonna has been making music for like 30 years, and Gaga's only been around for about 4

Video showing more material GaGa copied from MADONNA set to the song 'Thief of Hearts': http://vimeo.com/tensacross/ode to blahblah  
RT @TommyCalderone: Queen Of Pop Is In Abu Dhabi  Just by trending 'Queen Of Pop' instead of Madonna shows how threatened they are by Gaga.
I still love Madonna because there was a time she wasn't a shady cunt and she also has a great discography... Sad how insecure she's become.
I seriously don't understand people saying Madonna copies Gaga. Madonna didn't get her minge out in a music video did she 
but do the ppl in my fanbase know that saying Born This Way is their favorite Madonna song is actually taking a jab at Gaga or
Tired of Gaga fans hating on Madonna. Gaga is great but Madonna is legendary. #GetOverIt
@alisyavanova and I believe that she, unlike Madonna, can settle on one man without whoring around looking for dick every other month.
If I ever meet Madonna I'm telling her to apologize to gaga.
100 Million Views For Born This Way! Thanks Madonna :D
@BrianOrton86 At least Madonna works out. Can't say that about GaGa who snorts crack backstage before her shows and doesn't eat.

@VoodooUnicorn Madonna is the latrine cleaner. Gaga is the goddess of planet earth. Period.
Gaga will be the queen when Britney retires and Madonna dies.
:O RT @Ladygaga Madonna Shows Are The Best!
@cthulhuchick @AngryLibraryGuy or is it reductive as #madonna said of #gaga 
Gaga is not Pop, Gaga is Art, Madonna is commercial   plastic pop #DealWithit.
In just 4 years, Lady Gaga has managed to sell 1/3rd of Madonna's total worldwide sales, which took her 30 years.
How can ppl call Lady Gaga the queen of pop when she hasn't done a SIXTEENTH of what Madonna or even
