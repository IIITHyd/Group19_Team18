@KrysiaJ @ClaireRDXB @EmmaPinkyB Do I need to chase HSBC do you think  I prefer not to talk to them unless absolutely neccesary!
Loving the new layout of Sky HD and hating HSBC! lol
i am annoyed @ HSBC Philippines, grrrrr!!!!!
@Ntovorni yeah, they've been opening more of them. We used to have HSBC. But god does that bank suck.
@salmaelshurafa Will do   I've really wasted my time with the Air Miles program with HSBC. Should've done this ages ago.

Also I hate hsbc, so much wasted time   george if you are reading my tweets, I am not your biggest fan. #timeismoney #ihavebetterthingstodo
