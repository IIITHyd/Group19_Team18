HER  Why does it say Toyota on the window of your Lexus  ME         
@SimplySassy1 @WastedLunatic infiniti and nissan are the same company same cars same as toyota and lexus..acura n honda just luxury versions
Infinity owns Nissan, Lexus owns Toyota, Acura owns Honda, Porsche owns Audi   Volkswagon. That's why the certain car brands look the same.
A Lexus aint nun bt a Toyota with a L on it
Why do Altezza owners find it necessary to label them 'Lexus'
