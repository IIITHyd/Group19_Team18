#F1: Hamiton slam dunks Alonso. Vettel all over the back of the Ferrari.
#F1: Hamilton posts fastest lap from the lead. Vettel still admiring the Ferrari gearbox from P3.
Speaking spanish is a cheeky ferrari ploy. Everyone else speaks english, WHY must they ALWAYS be different !
#Ferrari should have pitted #Alonso on the lap right after Hamilton. #F1 @InsideFerrari
@An4ndPaTiL Lewis has fresh tyres where as the ferrari had had then tyres for over 40 laps!
Oh my hat #ThatAwkwardMoment when you drive a Ferrari and get overtaken by a Lotus for a place on the podium hahaha
Alonso can't do anything about Perez, who edges past the Ferrari on DRS to take the final podium slot. #F1
LAP 69 Perez glides by Alonso for P3 as the Ferrari is defenseless against the Sauber. #F1 #F112YUL #YUL
Not at all  chuckles RT @babysbu: U against Ferrari neh  RT idashKB: Lmao RT @F1grid: Perez passes Alonso for P3. Wow wow wow #F1 #Formula1
@cliniquebee @2112jelena @TomitaAlonso but it was a track against ferrari characteristics and we're only 2 points off the leader
