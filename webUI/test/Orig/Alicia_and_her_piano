I'd take Norah Jones but really Alicia Keys Piano more artistic
And Alicia Keys was making love that piano lol
Alicia Keys love climbin on them pianos ..
when Alicia Keys climbed on that piano during the Prince tribute, lmfaoo   
If I could play the piano like Alicia Keys and sing like Maxwell I'll sing for any female I catch feelings for...
