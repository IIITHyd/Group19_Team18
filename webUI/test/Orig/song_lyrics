To paraphrase AC/DC: it's lonely at the top if you want to rock n' roll.
Why don't you hang up, Won't you back up Will you pack up and head for higher ground, I know you and, you know me, Skies on Fire ! AC/DC
  She was a fast machine. She kept her motor clean, was the best damned woman that I ever seen...   AC/DC
  When the devil come a callin' I aint gonna be around, I'll kick, I creep crawl down your street, and gouge your eyes out...   #AC/DC
Cause the walls start shaking, the earth was quaking, my mind was aching, and we were making it #AC/DC #cruisingsong
Aerosmith said it right.   I don't wanna close my eyes. I don't wanna fall asleep cause I'll miss you babe...   I don't wanna miss a thing.  
you've been dusted with the devil while he sweeps you off your feet #Aerosmith.
