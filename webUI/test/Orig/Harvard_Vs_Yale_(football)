@JoselinMane rooting for Yale. Grew up around here, so seems fitting. Jealous of the concert! And work on a Saturday  Go get em!
I'm told Harvard Yale is like BC Notre Dame for the Protestant crowd.
Hahah all of the Yale fans look like straight nerds! #OfCourse
I'm sure there are many great places to watch #theGame besides the Yale Bowl. The HCNY has got to be nearly top of the list. #goCrimson #fb
