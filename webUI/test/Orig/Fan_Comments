  The Beatles were shit   said nobody because that's the stupidest thing I've heard and if you believe that you should bathe yourself in acid
I don't trust anybody who doesn't like the Beatles.
The Beatles were truly an amazing band. If you don't like them then please slap yourself.
it's the BEATLES :O
Clearly saving the best to last Stevie Wonder now Madness in the roof with brill use of images then a bit of Wings   Beatles to take it home
I think Macca looks bloody good for his age! Looking forward to a load of classic Beatles hits!
I wish the Beatles were still knocking around
If only the Beatles were still going!
@IGumleeey I hope you are watching McCartney #beatles
see if all the Beatles were still alive   together, I would be soooo happy.
Shame the best Beatles are dead...
everyone loves a bit of the beatles, no matter who you are
Paul McCartney needs auto tune treatment, the Beatles music was wasted on that generation.
@AnitaYLowe Dan loves The Beatles, LOVES. I'm not allowed to sing along :(
Two things: If you don't like the Beatles, I don't like you. And Sex Pistols should be the national anthem #godsavethequeen
