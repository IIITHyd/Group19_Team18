I'd eat nothing but boiled potatoes for the rest of my life if it meant all U2 songs were erased forever.
Why put an unseen text on U2  Failed. Hate you U2 #theedge #fuckoff
U2 are so unbelievably shit.
You can't be my friend if you like Creed, Nickelback, Limp Bizkit, ICP, or U2.
@Tess Melvin @vhoogerdijk @jordynicolex @dylanhoogerdijk only thSt they're the most overrated band since U2 #shit #freerazorbladeperalbum
Radom tweet: U2 is a little overrated. #JustSaying
As if I didn't hate both teams enough, now I have to hear a shitty U2 song going in to the break   #KillMeNow. #Finals
Upstairs is playing u2... #nonononononono #worstband
@sassykitty2 Yes, they are. U2 close second.
