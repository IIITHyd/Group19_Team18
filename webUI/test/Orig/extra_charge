Want to get rid of HSBC Business Banking: FGN Payment Limit bank charge   http://nsuentrepreneurshipinstitute.com/hsbc business banking fgn payment limit bank charge/  
really HSBC   45 CAD to transfer money from my HSBC CAD account to my HSBC account in France, then THEY charge me 30 . Outrageous!
Anyone have HSBC Business Banking   Look on your statements as they have automatically started a monthly charge for international payments
