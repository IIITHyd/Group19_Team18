The volvo has a flat battery   it won't jump start for some reason
If Volvo puts out an application, would you instead of applying complain that their cars don t fly because you need it for work 
@zh1nt0 If volvo had advertised that their cars would FLY, yes i would keep complaining ultil they delivered what they promised.
Insert Volvo nav update cd. 'This update can take 5 hours to complete and will stop when you turn off the engine'... WTH !
