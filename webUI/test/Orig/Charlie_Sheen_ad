Really sick of the Charlie Sheen Fiat ad.
It must be thanks to Charlie Sheen. After a sluggish start, Fiat's sales are now zipping ahead | http://ti.me/Lx7xLA  (via @TIMEMoneyland)

i love to watch charlie sheen driving the FIAT 500 Abarth in his crib..i love that car and commercial lol
Even if charlie sheen does manage to fit his hookers into a fiat 500, he won't have room for jumbo revs or 8 balls ..
@charliesheen in that #fiat commercial is full of #win.
Does it concern anyone else that Charlie sheen is so broke he's advertising for Fiat 
Fiat insists on having a washed up meth head and a Puerto Rican who outside of her looks is totally worthless be their spokespeople. Oh
Fiat killed it with a Charlie sheen commercial
Fiat... If you can drive it inside your house its not a car its a toy.
Who does fiat choose to be their spokes person  Fucking Charlie sheen.
@bbell990 maybe I'll let you drive the fiat, she purrs #charliesheenin #rentalcar
