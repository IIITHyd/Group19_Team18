Check out the new Toyota Commercial that I consulted for . I was the 2nd choice out of many, this kid beat me out. http://shoptradition.com/blog.html entry B20120604.01  
Just saw two of Toyota's Mothers of Invention, @SOCCKET's Jessica Matthews   Julia Silverman, in a Best Buy commercial! #ToyotaWomen
Why is LL Cool J tha voice of tha dog on tha Toyota commercial lls
Fed Ex Stolen Idea http://toyotastrategy.com/fed ex stolen idea.032012   #toyota
The   push the limits   Toyota Tacoma ad song causes me to want to strangle the singer
I think Toyota is onto something with using LL Cool J as the voice of a dog's train of thought. I smell a short lived sitcom in the works.
That Toyota commercial jus now was pretty bad ass
That toyota Corolla commercial is toooo funny....mom im signing with corolla hahaha
The old guy in the toyota commercial sounds just like Owen Wilson
That Lapaz Toyota song tho....Maddest Jam ....Ghanian flow sounds so Fresh
These Toyota Tundra ads make me giggle a bit every time they say 'tranny'
They're actually paid by Toyota to make this. http://www.youtube.com/watch v QLACISoFLiw feature plcp  
The Toyota Prius  I want my MPG  commercial to the tune of  Money for Nothing  makes me want to murder. Damn you, Dire Straits.
I love Coach T in the Toyota commercials!!
That Fuckin Evergreen Kia Car Commercial Is Wild As Fugg. Hella Naked Men Trynna Sell Cars.
One of my favorite Motley Crue songs is now in a Kia ad. Could not be more upset.
The new KIA advert is horrible. Horrible car and horrible band doing a horrible cover of my favourite Buzzcocks song. Horrible.
Seeing the Kia's driving and automatically I expect to see those stupid hamsters
Wonder what made Kia choose a Buzzcocks song to plug their new supermini #orgasmaddict
Long ass commercial break  .  No nigga, I don't wanna buy no fucking Kia Optima, I'm tryna see the damn game .      .
Cultural expungement via advertising. A morass of safe. Fuck you #Kia cars, and fuck you football.
ITV should have shown the KIA advert instead of Gerrads goal then for the banter!
They make it seem like he's in a mid life crisis and to spice it up he says,   I'm gonna listen to M tley Cr e and buy a Kia Sorrento!  
@GaryLineker was gutted itv had the England game , nice to see no mid game advert for a Kia hatchback tho #allenglandgamesonbbc
The kia cee'd advert is pants
