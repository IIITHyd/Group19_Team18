Blk guy dressed as a gangster came in with Coldplay blasting on iPod. I'm white, wearing a plaid polo, with Notorious BIG playing.
Coldplay is the Cream of Wheat of pop music. Not bad, doesn't hurt you, but half an hour later you're hungry for something more substantial.
@DerekNeurer I'm scared for the rest of the playlist being coldplay:|
The entire @coldplay Mylo Xyloto album is a good representation of my life at the moment.
Coldplay and Rihanna, who would've thought it'd be such mad collab.
I wear knit hats because it's cold out. You wear knit hats because of coldplay
