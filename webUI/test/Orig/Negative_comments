@habarosen The Beatles were the result of Chuck Norris' 4th grade science project.
The beatles  
think I must be the only person from Liverpool who finds the beatles boring..
Couldn't give a toss about the beatles.
Paul mccartney and the Beatles are the most overated musicians!
Paul McCartney carrying on after The Beatles is stupid. That's like having Lotus after Colin Cha... Oh wait.
Don't really care much for the Beatles I rather five #everybodygetup
I will get so much hate for this, but I think the Beatles are over rated
@londonlipgloss i'm surprised i've not had any from people about my lack of enthusiasm for the beatles   macca!
@Fiona Trewavas Sorry, was my contribution to the Beatles. Feel that Mr McCartney has lost his upper range a little these days!
@orla gh I've never really been into the beatles tbh! :( :L
the fact that the whole of dundee is now claiming to love the beatles is making me depressed.
@Andreajay1985 my dad thinks it hilarious how much I hate him and the Beatles lol
@bennicordy Problem with the Beatles is the distinct lack of rap!! That would have made them the real deal...
@sallycamsell no John Lennon was a fony and a cheat, read up on it, you'll find the beatles were not the happy band you think
#OverratedBands the beatles. seriously. they weren't that amazing.
The beatles are shite and Paul McCartney can suck my big toe
