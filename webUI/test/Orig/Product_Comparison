One Direction's   What Makes You Beautiful   sold faster in the U.S. than The Beatles' first single.
@NichKent It's nothing like their other stuff. It's sort of Beatles esque, you should listen. You have to know what you're judging me for.
People shouldn't cover Beatles songs. I've never heard a Beatles cover I liked.
@MonkJammas it seems silly to mark us down for not being a piano and guitar, become the next Beatles game
John Mayer is in the same category as the Beatles for me. Zero care.
justin beiber should never, EVER be compared to The Beatles! just saying. #factfuckingfact
The Beatles   One Direction
heard a person call the radio station and say   one direction will be bigger than the #beatles in less than a year.   This person is stupid.

Forget the Beatles, Rolling stones   the Jackson 5. Kool   the Gang are the best freaking band the world has ever seen! #GetDownOnIt
@saramillerb @yellosnowcone The Beatles were like the One Direction of the 60s right 
RT   @elliebrazierxo i have nothing against one direction but its beyond me how people can actually compare them to the beatles or something  
many people worship Justin Bieber as if he's as good as The Beatles or Michael Jackson. Most people these days dont have good taste in music
People are saying 1d are better than the beatles , are u all tripping   1d can't touch the beetles u fucking faggots !
Flo Rida's  Low  has sold 8 million copies   the same as The Beatles'  Hey Jude

if only the Beatles were still going we wouldn't have to listen to half the crap on the radio!
I think Boyz II Men have always been better than the Beatles.
Wings, the band The Beatles could have been.
Paul McCartney. Lead singer of Wings. The band the Beatles could have been. #partridge
I like the Beatles, but I prefer the Beach Boys. That's not a joke.
Why can't we just swap JLS for the Beatles  Everyone likes the Beatles. Come on god DO iT
@stealthMizzle Which will run out first, queens or surviving Beatles

Infinity owns Nissan, Lexus owns Toyota, Acura owns Honda, Porsche owns Audi   Volkswagon. That's why the certain car brands look the same.

@RomaTweetcorn LADY GAGA forever!!! Justin Bieber DEAD!!!!
One thing I'm glad that I never heard Justin say was:   Hi, I'm Justin Bieber and you're watching Disney Channel.  
Stop comparing 1D with Taylor Swift. And stop comparing 1D with Justin Bieber. They have nothing similar. A UK boy band and Solo Artists.
Justin Bieber vs Miley Cyrus is on the UK music channel 'The Vault' at 4pm! Thanks @DestineeParisUK and @MileyxUpdates.
