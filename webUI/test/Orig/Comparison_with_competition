@ChrisV6255 @evoNickTrott How about top down motoring with a side of BMW M straight six  Z4 M Roadsters can be had for less than 15k
Thats a problem of Audi of note  they don t tend to stick to the  correct times  to update their cars relative to BMW   MB.
The Ferrari V8s are strangely muffled out by the BMW Z4s #Blancpain
@Elevate IX It will be glorious. BMW M5's, 4th gear at 6000 RPMs whilst dodging cars full of slow driving families.

@VanBird Definitely a Jaguar in the pic. However, agree that #maserati is the car to drive!
The Script, The Beatles, John Mayer. Sublime, Led Zeppelin, and The Fray   YMCMB. No question.
And if any of you believe you are 'indie', then you would pick Led Zeppelin over Drake and Kanye for sure. Amateurs.
Paul McCartney   Led Zeppelin   Guns N Roses   Pink Floyd   Mana   Cafe Tacuba   Magneto   Gloria Trevi   Tatiana   Justin Bieber
Led Zeppelin, REM, and Depeche Mode have never had a number one single, Rihanna has 10
   Led Zeppelin: Stairway to Heaven, 1971 AC/DC : Highway To Hell, 1979   lols
@Un hueon mas es como decir the doors o led Zeppelin 
GIVEAWAY: Is Bowie the equal of Dylan, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd 
I was just minding my own, listening to some Led Zeppelin, and this guy asked if it was Nickelback and now there's so much blood everywhere
@Insane Payne tbh they were better than Oasis at Knebworth, they were up there with Led Zeppelin and Queen.
@MandaSwaggie You're comparing Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, and Justin Bieber  On which frequency does your brain work 
Little bit worried that 'Genius' in iTunes recommends 'Led Zeppelin   Bombay Bicycle Club'   that's fine   then it suggests 'The Satudays' !
Its like he wants us to be liked by everyone. I mean Led Zeppelin didnt write tunes everybody liked. They left that to the Bee Gees.
I am convinced that The Foo Fighters are the Led Zeppelin of our generation. Simply amazing rock music.
Hardest decision I've had to make in the last few days is whether to listen to Led Zeppelin or RHCP. Not sure if I'm happy or sad about this
Ya gotta hand it to jack white for ripping off led zeppelin more artfully than kingdom come and whitesnake!
In my opinion, The Beatles are a joke. I'm not a fan of old music but Queen and Led Zeppelin were where it was at.
Amazing band. Amazing artwork. Spiritual Beggars Ad Astra. Arch enemy meets led zeppelin http://instagr.am/p/NeINmuL9UV/
