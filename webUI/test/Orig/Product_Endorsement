The Beatles were a british boy band who played their own instruments and wrote their own songs. i think thats pretty neat
I love The Beatles.
  insert Beatles song here   by the Beatles is one of the best songs ever.
The Beatles are great
Recomendo    Oasis, Arctic Monkeys, Kaiser Chiefs, The kooks, Snow Patrol, Strokes, Beatles, Panic! At the Disco, Red Hot, Coldplay
Nothing beats a bit of Queen, Guns N' Roses or the Beatles at 5.22am at 100  volume. #classics
The former Beatles show was so good
Okey. The Beatles got swag.
The Beatles are a remarkably good band.
Dear England, we liked it better when you gave us The Beatles. Got any more of those types of Boy Bands over there
