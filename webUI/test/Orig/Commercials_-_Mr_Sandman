nobody dreamin bout a kia. #bereal
I had a dream that I was an american made automobile. I went to car school and got beat up by a bunch of KIA Rio at recess.
A Kia wouldn't be in my dream.
That song mr sandman from that kia commercial is scary.
No one in their best dream would be driving a KIA sedan...
Kia is getting every dollars worth if their SuperBowl commercial...how many times have we seen the Sandman commercial
Kia really needs a new commercial. The sandman one is getting extremely old!
That kia commercial is so weird lol mr.sandman
I would do anything to have a dream like the guy in the Kia commercial .
