@TinaDaheley you have been very quiet Tina. Did you sort Barclays out 
Waiting in Barclays to open an account for when I get to Eton. This is going to take ages
Ordered new bank card at 16:50 on friday, arrived this morning #barclays are fast : )
So I went into Barclays to delete my overdraft. She said I should take a seat
Another barclays related tweet for you all. I've been sitting here for just under an hour and have achieved nothing. God sake.
