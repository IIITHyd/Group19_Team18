Scratch a Yale man with both hands and you'll be lucky to find a coast guard. Usually you find nothing at all.   F. Scott Fitzgerald

@Yale Great Advances on AstroPhysics, better try them into Noetic Science.
Plus, at a place like Yale, all that matters is the degree. Still, Ivies can't hide behind the   academics first   banner anymore.
Yale HAS TO have a quota for      !!!! No offense
