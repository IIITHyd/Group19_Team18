Bad planning #Ferrari very poor idea! Go on PER show'em you need to be in MAS seat!
#Alonso is a sitting duck #F1 #Canadian Grand Prix! #Ferrari made a huge mistake staying out, knew they had! Goooo #Hamilton #McLaren
Exscuse me if i scream my lungs off shortly. Bwahahahahahaha #Ferrari tactics #Fail #F1
@therealdcf1 how wrong did Ferrari get it 15 sec lead why not pit for new super softs crazy    
I think that will teach Ferrari to respond. These tyres just drop off the cliff like a lead weight. #SkyF1
yet another MASSIVE mistake by the #Ferrari strategists  i thought after the last race last season they would have been fired  #f1 #alonso
I bloody hate to see my team get slaughtered like this... But Ferrari forever !!! @alo oficial @InsideFerrari @alonsofanpage
If someone could publish the story of what Ferrari were taking on the pit wall   what a lousy call! #f1
You can say that again! RT @F1 Madness: Vettel passes Alonso   what a seriously bad call by Ferrari #F1 #CanadianGP
What a shit day! Ireland gonna lose, Tennis final is rained out, and Ferrari incompetence on show again. #Imgoingtobed
Ferrari needs to answer many qs this week...from a leader to a total failure...amazing race by Grojo and ever impressive perez #F1
Depressing end of race for Ferrari, their strategy completely backfired...
How the phuck did th@ happen..phuckin team ferrari
