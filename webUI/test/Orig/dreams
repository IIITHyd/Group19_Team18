So my dream last night: I was on stage playing drums for U2 and I forgot the parts to every song. Everyone was booing even the rest of U2.x
@garysnowpatrol I just lost all respect for U2. I don't care how sucky a drummer you were in that dream, that's just mean. Not cool, Bono.
I had a dream I was a bass player for U2 last night amazing!
