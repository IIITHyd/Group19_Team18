Tweet Cluster: Capital One Bowl
Named Entity: FACILITY
Summary:

    Ooh! 2008 Capital One Bowl ( @umichfootball v. @gatorzonefb) is on #BTN ... #goblue! (Spoiler: Henne kicks Tebow's butt!)
    Watching @TimTebow and the gators play Michigan in the Capital One Bowl game in 2008. Man I miss those days. The man is a #warrior
    My understanding is #LSU doesn't win the 2010 Capital One Bowl game. Basically the game doesn't exist/didn't happen. #Tigers 9 3, not 9 4
