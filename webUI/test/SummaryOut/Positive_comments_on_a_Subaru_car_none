Tweet Cluster: Positive comments on a Subaru car
Named Entity: NONE
Summary:

    That Subaru is a really good car. Served me well in B class.
    But still, they are not as efficient as a Renault Megane RS250, Ford Focus ST or Subaru WRX STI or the new toyota 86 aka Subaru BRZ.
    Subaru is probably my favorite overall AWD vehicle priced between  15 20k. Yours
