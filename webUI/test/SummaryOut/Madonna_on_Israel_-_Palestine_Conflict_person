Summary:
    
    I see people are bashing Madonna. First off, it's Madonna. She's controversial b/c that's her job. But she loves Israel   expressed this.
    In a nutshell, Madonna said   No matter how much land 'we' give back, there won't be peace unless we treat each other with dignity.  
    #freechen Madonna kicks off her MDNA world tour in Tel Aviv, Israel, wishing peace in the Middle East.
