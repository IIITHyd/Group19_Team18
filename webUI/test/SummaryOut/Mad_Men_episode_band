Tweet Cluster: Mad Men episode
Named Entity: BAND
Summary:

    I have watched #MadMen's   The Other Woman   about 5 times now.   the scene between Joan   Jaguar Guy still makes me cringe.
    Vintage ads from Jaguar and yes, they are better than Don Draper's. Much better... 
    Landing the Jaguar account took a lot of hard work and sacrifice. So why do I still feel under appreciated around here
