Tweet Cluster: Opinion about Oxford Comma
Named Entity: OTHER
Summary:

    BREAKING: I prefer the Ohio University comma to the Oxford comma. The Ohio University comma is when you pause between words to take a drink.
    @jonohutchison @seemsforever @RyanSproull @NZStuffTech I'm a big supporter of Oxford comma. Makes things neater, clearer, and easier to read
    Inappropriate, pausing, ftw!    @LATimesbooks: Goodbye, Oxford comma  Hello, Shatner comma!
