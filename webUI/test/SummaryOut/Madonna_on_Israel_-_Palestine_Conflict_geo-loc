Tweet Cluster: Madonna on Israel - Palestine Conflict
Named Entity: GEO-LOC
Summary:

    I see people are bashing Madonna. First off, it's Madonna. She's controversial b/c that's her job. But she loves Israel   expressed this.
    In a nutshell, Madonna said   No matter how much land 'we' give back, there won't be peace unless we treat each other with dignity.
