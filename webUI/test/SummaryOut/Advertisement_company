    Gotta feel bad for the poor bastard in Subaru ad. Even renting a balloon can t stop his wife from  affectionately  belittling him.
    that Subaru commercial where the lil boy keeps asking his neighbor    why    over  over and he says    idk why dont you ask your dad       lmao
    The new Subaru commercial is absolutely precious.
