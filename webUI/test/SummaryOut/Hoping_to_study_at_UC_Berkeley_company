Named Entity: COMPANY
Summary:

    Wow lot of great History classes being taught at Berkeley this semester. Wish I was still in school for those.
    Lmao remembering when @StephRami8 told @papa imrich   If you get into UC Berkeley I'm going to cut your face off and put it on mine  
    My other dream is to become an offensive coordinator at the University of California Berkeley or Stanford.
