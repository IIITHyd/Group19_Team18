    <br>
    <br>
    	There is a need for generating brief pseudo summaries per cluster for tweets related to a particular entity as there is a bulk volume of text generated by a micro blog sites like Twitter, that is being used by 200 million registered users, posting billions of tweets majority of posts are conversational or not particularly meaningful, about 3.6% of the posts concern topics of mainstream news. Users are forced to manually read and understand the posts in order to understand the conversation that is going on, about a particular topic. Hence there is a need for an automated summarizer to motivate the automation of this process.

    <div class="ire2014_report">
        <h3 class="ire2014_h3">1. Introduction</h3>
       Summarizing twitter tweets can be viewed as an instance of the more general problem of automated text summarization, which is the problem of automatically generating a condensed version of the most important content from one or more documents. A Twitter post or tweet is at most 140 characters long and in this study we only consider English posts. <br>

       In this project we approach the problem of summarization of tweets by first identifying the important entities from a cluster of tweets, which are assumed to be clustered already based on a topic. For each cluster we identify the most important entities from each type like Geographic location, Person etc using TF-IDF scores. Then we find most important tweets using these important entities. Finally we generate a brief sudo summary for each cluster using the important entities and important tweets.

        <h3 class="ire2014_h3">2. Approach</h3>

        The basic problem targetted in this project is to summarize the tweets by identifying most important entities. For each of those clusters we identify the most important entities from each type like the Geo location, Person etc. We find the most important tweets based on these most important entities. The approach we have followed is as follows

        <h4 class="ire2014_h4">2.1. Datasets</h4>
		We have used labeled tweets which are taken from RepLab[1] data set as the source data for generating summaries. RepLab is a competitive evaluation exercise for Online Reputation Management systems. In the dataset provided we have the set of tweets with the tweet id, author, entity id , text. We are also provided with a labeled dataset which has the fields of tweet id, author, entity id, filtering, polarity, topic, topic priority.        
	
        
        <h4 class="ire2014_h4">2.2. MVP Architecture</h4>
        <figure >
            <img src="18-19-images/Architecture.jpg" width="400px" height="300px">
			
            <figcaption>Caption 2 : MVP Architecture Model </figcaption>
        </figure>

                            
       
        <h4 class="ire2014_h4">2.3. Base Clusters generation</h4>
		Using labeled data we have generated Base tweet clusters, for further processing, using the tweet topic name. 
        
	<h4 class="ire2014_h4">2.4. Named entity recogniser </h4>
		We have used Aritter[2] NLP tool for identifying named entities, attributes and attribute relations.
For each cluster of tweets, we ran Aritter NER tool to classify tweet entities and extracted all entities apart from type “O”, as identified by Aritter tool, as important keywords and generated TF-IDF counts for them. Also, while generating summaries we have taken location (“geo-loc” named entity as per Aritter classification) as the most priority type among all named entities.

	<h4 class="ire2014_h4">2.5. Summary Generated per cluster </h4>
		Generate a map of named entity type vs named entities for the list of all tweets and call this map as NETYPE_MAP which looks like as given below. <br>
	"geo-loc" => &lt ne &gt,&lt ne &gt ... <br>
	"person" => &lt ne &gt,&lt ne &gt ... <br>
	... <br>
	<br>

	Tweet summary can be of three types. Collect the named entities of max TF-IDF count. 

	<ul class="ire2014_list">
            <li><b>Case I:</b> When the named entities with max TF-IDF's all are of location type: <br>
		<br>
		Print the summary as the collection of tweet texts which contains the named entities with max TF-IDF counts of location type.</li>

            <li><b>Case II:</b> When no location type named entities has maximum TF-IDF and only first the max TF-IDF named entity type is "important" :
		<br>
		A named entity type is marked as "important" only if its TF-IDF count is not less than half of the max TF-IDF count i.e. a named entity type with TF-IDF count as max2 is marked as important named entity type only if: <br>
			2 * max2  &ge;  max  -- Equation 1 <br>
		Where max is the max TF-IDF count for an NE type in the cluster <br>
<pre>
GLOBAL_INT_TW <= {}
GLOBAL_UNION_TW <= {}
for the NE in max tf-idf NE type in NETYPE_MAP
      find intersection of contained tweet ids for 
      each NE (say INTERSECTION_TWEETS)

      find union of contained tweet ids for
      each NE (say UNION_TWEETS)

      if the next NE type is not "important" then
           if INT_TW is not empty and INT_TW &le; 2 then
               print summary as the collection of tweet texts 
               in INTERSECTION_TWEETS
               STOP;
           else if UNION_TWEETS is not empty and 
               UNION_TWEETS &le; 2 then
               print summary as the collection of tweet texts 
               in UNION_TWEETS
               STOP;
           else /* Check other named entity types */      (2)
              for each NE type in NETYPE_MAP
                 find intersection of INTERSECTION_TWEETS               
                 with GLOBAL_INT_TW and store results in 
                 GLOBAL_INT_TW.

                 find Union of UNION_TWEETS               
                 with GLOBAL_UNION_TW and store results in 
                 GLOBAL_UNION_TW.
       
                 find intersection of contained tweet ids for 
                 each NE (say INTERSECTION_TWEETS)

      find union of contained tweet ids for
      each NE (say UNION_TWEETS)

    if INT_TW is not empty then
         print summary as the collection of tweet texts 
         in INTERSECTION_TWEETS
         STOP;
    else if UNION_TWEETS is not empty then
         print summary as the collection of tweet texts 
         in UNION_TWEETS
         STOP;

</pre>
	    </li>
	    <li>
		<b> Case III: </b>When the max TF-IDF named entity types are of location and other types (Mixed case): <br>
 
			This becomes a sub-case of case 2 (Refer (2) in Case II). <br>
	    </li>
        </ul>

	<h4 class="ire2014_h4">2.6. Web UI for Summaries </h4>
	
		We generate a web UI for the tweet cluster summaries which are of the following format. <br>

			Cluster Label: @ &lt;Location&gt; <br>
			&lt;List of Named entities&gt; <br>
			&lt;Tweet Cluster Summary &gt; <br>


        <h3 class="ire2014_h3">3. Results</h3>
		        We have generated pseudo summaries for tweet clusters and will analyze the summaries with that of text rank tool.<br/>
